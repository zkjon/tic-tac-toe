# Tic-Tac-Toe

A collection of Tic-Tac-Toe game implementations in multiple programming languages.

## Description

This repository contains implementations of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game (also known as Noughts and Crosses) in various programming languages. Each implementation provides a simple yet engaging gaming experience where two players take turns marking spaces on a 3×3 grid, with the objective of placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. This project serves as both a fun game collection and a learning resource for comparing programming approaches across different languages.

## Features

- Multiple programming language implementations
- Consistent game rules across all versions
- Clean and intuitive user interfaces
- Two-player gameplay on the same device
- Learning resource for comparing programming patterns and idioms
- Responsive design where applicable

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Requirements vary by implementation language
- Each language subdirectory has its own specific requirements

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/zkjon/tic-tac-toe.git
   cd tic-tac-toe
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific language implementation:
   ```
   cd [language-directory]
   ```

3. Follow the README instructions within that language's directory:
   ```
   # Each language implementation has its own setup and run instructions
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the application using the method described in the installation section.
2. The game starts with Player X making the first move.
3. Players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their mark (X or O).
4. The game ends when one player gets three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or when all cells are filled without a winner (draw).
5. Use the reset button to start a new game.
